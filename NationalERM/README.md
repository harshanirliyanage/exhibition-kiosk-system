##🖥 Exhibition Visitor Registration Kiosk System

A full-stack Kiosk-Based Visitor Registration System developed for Central Industries PLC (National PVC Division) and successfully deployed during a 3-day exhibition at BMICH, Colombo.

The system digitally registered visitors and provided a 35% special discount for registered customers while securely storing visitor data for future business engagement.

##🚀 Project Overview

This kiosk application was designed to:

                            Digitally register exhibition visitors

                            Capture structured visitor information

                            Provide eligibility confirmation for a 35% discount

                             Store data securely in a centralized database

                             Operate smoothly in a live exhibition environment
